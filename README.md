# Virtual Foster Closet

This project was created by Derek Smale, Jon Deviney, Kim Leibowitz, and Nathan Ravenscraft. Virtual Foster Closet is an app that mainstreams a way for foster families to send a request of items they need for their foster child (children) and have a donor reach out and donated said items.

In this React app, we are using tools such as Material-UI, Tachyons, Immer, Axios, React-Router-Dom, Styled-Components, React-Select, and Twilio. Our backend developer, Nathan, wrote API's in Django for us to store data in.
